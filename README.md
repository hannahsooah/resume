# Resume
My resume in all its glory

## Usage
Feel free to use your favorite editor and LaTeX compiler.

Optionally, a `Dockerfile` is included that spins up a container to compile the
LaTeX file to avoid having to setup and install a LaTeX compiler, fonts, etc yourself.
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/aeolyus/resume.git
cd resume/
make
```
